- Remove any mention of Trie types other than SimpleTrie.

- Make BoggleSolvers assume ownership of their Tries.

- Make this method:
static BoggleSolver* BoggleSolver::Instantiate(int size, const char* dict);

This would return either a Boggler, Boggler3 or Boggler34 depending on size. It
could even produce a restricted Trie for the boggler based on the board size.

- Add a HillClimber class to optimizer.{h,cc} and compare to Annealer.

- Move tests over to googletest (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)
