Code for speeding up boggle by reducing shared work between solving similar
boards. Does some precomputation on boards w/ the top-left and bottom-right
corners cut out to evaluate 26*26=676 boards by looking at only three.

Abandoned because the speedup wasn't spectacular (the precomputation step
is significantly more expensive than solving a board).
